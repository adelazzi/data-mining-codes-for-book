### 🔮 Classification Spells
*Perfect for when you know what you're looking for*

| Spell | Best For | File |
|:------|:---------|:-----|
| **Decision Trees** | Interpretable decisions | `classifications/decision_trees.py` |
| **K-Nearest Neighbors** | Simple, robust classification | `classifications/knn.py` |
| **Naive Bayes** | Text and probabilistic data | `classifications/naive_bayes.py` |
| **Support Vector Machine** | High-dimensional separation | `classifications/svm.py` |

### ✨ Clustering Spells
*Your cartographers for uncharted data territories*

| Spell | Best For | File |
|:------|:---------|:-----|
| **K-Means** | Fast, spherical clusters | `clustering/kmeans.py` |
| **PAM** | Robust to outliers | `clustering/pam.py` |
| **AGNES** | Hierarchical clustering | `clustering/agnes.py` |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-mining-book.git
cd data-mining-book
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage
```python
# Classification example
from classifications.decision_trees import DecisionTree
from classifications.evaluation_metrics import evaluate

model = DecisionTree()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = evaluate(y_test, predictions)

# Clustering example
from clustering.kmeans import KMeans

clusterer = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
labels = clusterer.fit_predict(data)
```

## 📜 The Wizard's Oath (Best Practices)

- **Experiment Freely**: Tweak parameters to see how outcomes change
- **Validate Your Results**: Always test your models properly
- **Choose Wisely**: Different algorithms work better for different problems
- **Keep Learning**: Each dataset teaches you something new
